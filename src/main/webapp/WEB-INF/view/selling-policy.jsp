            <p>
              You may not send unsolicited or inappropriate messages. All communications to customers must be sent through Buyer-Seller Messaging and be necessary for fulfilling the order or providing customer services. Marketing communications are prohibited.

              If you receive customer information such as addresses or phone numbers to fulfill orders, you may use that information only to fulfill orders and must delete it after the order has been processed. You may not use customer information to contact customers (except through Buyer-Seller Messaging) or share it with any third-party.

            <p>
              You may not attempt to circumvent the Dhaansu sales process or divert Dhaansu customers to another website. This means that you may not provide links or messages that prompt users to visit any external website or complete a transaction elsewhere.

            <h5 class="mt-4 mb-2">Multiple Selling Accounts on Dhaansu</h5>
            <p>
              You may only maintain one Seller Central account for each region in which you sell unless you have a legitimate business need to open a second account and all of your accounts are in good standing. If any of your accounts are not in good standing, we may deactivate all of your selling accounts until all accounts are in good standing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Examples of a legitimate business justification include:

                <li>
                  You manufacture products for two distinct and separate companies
                </li>
                <li>
                  You are recruited for an Dhaansu program that requires separate accounts

            <h5 class="mt-4 mb-2">Filing Infringement Notices as an Agent or Brand Protection Agency</h5>
            <p>
              Dhaansu understands that many brands may choose to have brand protection agencies or agents report intellectual property infringement on their behalf and accepts submissions from authorized agents. However, Dhaansu does not permit individuals with active selling accounts to file infringement notices as an agent of a brand when the filing of those notices could benefit their own selling account (through removing competing listings, for example). Any sellers filing notices as an agent to benefit their own status as a seller may have their selling account terminated.
