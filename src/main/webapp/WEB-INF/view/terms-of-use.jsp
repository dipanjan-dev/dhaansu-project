              Dhaansu attempts to be as accurate as possible.

            <h5 class="mt-4 mb-2">PRICING</h5>
            <p>
              "List Price" means the suggested retail price of a product as provided by a manufacturer, supplier, or seller. We regularly check List Prices against prices recently found on Dhaansu and other retailers. Certain products may have a "Was Price" displayed, which is determined using recent price history of the product on Dhaansu.
            </p>
            <p>
              With respect to items sold by Dhaansu, we cannot confirm the price of an item until you order. Despite our best efforts, a small number of the items in our catalog may be mispriced. If the correct price of an item sold by Dhaansu is higher than our stated price, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before shipping or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. Other merchants may follow different policies in the event of a mispriced item.
            </p>
            <p>
              We generally do not charge your credit card until after your order has entered the shipping process or, for digital products, until we make the digital product available to you.
